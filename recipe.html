        <h2><strong>Shepherd's Pie</strong></h2>
        <img class="imgc" src="images/ShepherdsPie.jpg" alt="Delicious Shepherd's Pie" width="500" height="500">
        <p>Shepherd's Pie is a alternative to Cottage Pie. Shepherd's Pie uses ground lamb while Cottage Pie uses ground beef. Serving it with mashed potatoes just makes my mouth water just thinking about it.<p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Meat Filling</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>2 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
          <li>2 lb. 90% lean ground lamb</li>
          <li>4 teaspoons dried parsley leaves</li>
          <li>2 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves</li>
          <li>2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
          <li>4 minced garlic cloves</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
          <li>2 cup chicken broth</li>
          <li>2 cup frozen mixed peas & carrots</li>
          <li>1 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Potato topping</p>
        <ul>
          <li>3 - 4 lb. russet potatoes peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
          <li>16 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
          <li>2/3 cup half & half</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
          <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
          <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.</li>
          <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.</li>
          <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li>
          <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.</li>
          <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesnâ€™t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2><strong>Pecan Pie</strong></h2>
        <img class="imgc" src="images/PecanPie.jpg" alt="Delicious Pecan Pie" width="500" height="333">
        <p>Pecan Pie is one of my favorite desserts. Its sweet, filling and goes well with whipped cream.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Pillsbury Pie crust</li>
          <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>3 Tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
          <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1/3 cup salted butter, softened or melted</li>
          <li>3 eggs</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups pecan halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare pie crust and place pie dough in an 9 inch pie dish.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl mix together sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, and softened or melted butter. Mix in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
          <li>Reserve a few pecans and stir the rest into the batter. Pour into unbaked pie shell. Add a few of the reserved pecans on top of the pie in any empty spots, to make it look pretty. Use a small spoon to cover them with batter.</li>
          <li>Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, then lower the oven temp to 350 degrees F and continue baking for about 40 minutes. Check the pie half way through cooking and tent a large piece of greased aluminum foil over the top of the pie. (I tent it high so it doesn't touch the pie filling).</li>
          <li>You will know your pecan pie is done when you can shake it gently and it is not overly jiggly.  If it jiggles a lot when shaking, continue cooking until the center is more set, 5-10 more minutes.</li>
          <li>Allow pie to cool completely for several hours before cutting and serving. Or refrigerate for 1-3 days, until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
